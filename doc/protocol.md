@brief Protocol to communicate information about movies and seat availability over TCP.

This protocol defines the format of messages exchanged between a client and a server to request and edit information about movies and available seats in a cinema. The messages are sent over a TCP connection.

The protocol consists of two types of messages: requests and responses. A request message is sent by
the client to request information about a specific movie, to reserve a seat or edit data inside the server . A response message is
sent by the server to provide the requested information or to confirm the request is done.
